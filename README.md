# Customer Analysis - Predicting Offer Acceptance

This project predicts whether a customer will accept an offer based on their demographics, spending behaviors, and past interactions. 

Key features include:
- **Demographics**: Education, Marital status, Income, etc.
- **Behavior**: Spending on products, web visits, catalog purchases.
- **Target Variable**: Response (Accepted or Not in the last campaign).

We use Random Forest Classifier to predict customer responses. The dataset is analyzed using visualizations and model evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.).

To run, install dependencies and execute `consumer_analysis.py` or open the jupyter notebook file.
